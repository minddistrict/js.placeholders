js.placeholders
***************

Introduction
============

This library packages `Placeholders.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`Placeholders.js`: https://github.com/jamesallardice/Placeholders.js

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.placeholders``) are published to some URL.
